Date:	The date in which you have clicked through to accept the terms of this Agreement

Between:	Swapstack, Inc. (**“Swapstack”**) 
					and
	you (**“Writer,” “Advertiser” or “You” (as applicable)**)

The terms and conditions of this User Agreement (the “**Agreement**”), together with Swapstack’s Terms of Service located at <https://swapstack.co/terms> and Privacy Policy located at [https://swapstack.co/privacy](https://swapstack.co/terms) shall govern your use of Swapstack’s online platform (the “**Platform**”) and the services provided on the Platform. The Platform shall consist of its home page located at **“<https://swapstack.co>,”** as well as any URL that is linked or navigable to from the home page. 

1. **Purpose of Swapstack**

   Swapstack has created an online platform for matching writers with businesses that are interested in engaging with writers for purposes of advertising and promoting their products, services and/or brands on newsletters and other media developed and distributed thereby.  By using the Platform, you agree and acknowledge that Swapstack may connect such Writers with Advertisers as may be necessary to achieve each party’s respective goals.  Advertisers and Users shall collectively be referred to herein as “**Users**”.  On and through the Platform, Writers and Advertisers may engage in the following ways, which functionalities may be amended, revised and/or expanded upon from time to time, in Swapstack’s sole discretion. 

   Swapstack’s Platform enables Users to request services based on the following types of advertising campaigns:

***Functionality 1: Self Service Campaigns***

```
Swapstack’s Self Service campaign offering enables Writers and Advertisers to connect on Swapstack’s virtual newsletter advertising marketplace. Using the Self Service functionality: (1) Writers are empowered to set pricing for advertisements available for sale on each such Writer’s newsletters or other media distributions, and (2) Advertisers avail themselves of such advertising opportunities, which may include, without limitation, Advertiser logo placement in newsletters, shout outs or other mentions in newsletters, sponsored posts, and deep dives focused on the Advertiser’s business, products or offerings.  If the Writer believes that there is a match and alignment of interests with any Advertiser on the Platform, Writer may click the “Intro” option to request an introduction to such Advertiser, which may be accepted or rejected by the Advertiser, as determined in its sole discretion.  If an “Intro” match is successful, Swapstack will connect the Writer and Advertiser via email or using chat functionalities on the Swapstack Platform.  Writer and Advertiser shall then be responsible for coordinating terms for any such business arrangement contemplated hereunder.


For detail regarding payments due for services rendered in connection with Self Service Campaigns, see “Section 2 – Payment; Software Integration.”
```

***Functionality #2 – Managed Campaigns***

```
Swapstack’s Managed Campaign service is an offering made available to Advertisers seeking customized advertising solutions.  Swapstack will work with interested Advertisers to create a Managed Campaign Advertiser account specific to these purposes, at which time each such interested Advertiser will scope its requests for Swapstack’s further processing, which may include, without limitation, sourcing newsletters with advertising availability, connecting the Advertiser with Writers, and closing advertising deals.  Swapstack will then manage all aspects of such Managed Campaign for Advertiser.  Advertiser may engage in such Managed Campaign by y agreeing to such arrangement with Swapstack directly.  


For detail regarding payments due for services rendered in connection with Managed Campaigns, see “Section 2 – Payment; Software Integration.”
```

***Functionality #3 – Plug & Play Campaigns***

```
Swapstack’s Plug & Play campaign is an affiliate program in which Writers can select from a set of pre-vetted advertising deals with Advertisers on the Platform.  Using the Plug & Play functionality, interested Advertisers complete a clickthrough menu in which they agree to certain pricing, payment and advertising terms without separately engaging with Writers, making such opportunities available to any interested Writer that accepts its terms.  Upon accepting an Advertiser’s Plug & Play offering, the Writer and Advertiser are automatically connected by Swapstack for further coordination and processing.  


For detail regarding payments due for services rendered in connection with Plug & Play Campaigns, see “Section 2 – Payment; Software Integration.”
```

***Functionality #4 – Tip Jars***

```
Swapstack’s Tip Jar is a service with which Writers can collect donations and “tips” from readers of their newsletters. Each Swapstack Writer is provided with a link to their externally available Tip Jar page which they can place where they like. Readers of the Writers content can choose on their own accord to tip a Writer. Writers will receive this payment directly into their Stripe accounts.
```

2. **Payment; Software Integration**

   *Software – Stripe Integration*

   You hereby agree and acknowledge that you have created, or shall have created prior to entering into any agreement with any Advertisers on the Platform, a Stripe Account on Stripe Connect, and that you shall be subject to all terms, conditions and obligations of Stripe Connect (or such other processor) users.  You further agree and acknowledge that upon creating a Stripe Account such account shall be deemed a “Connected Account” under the Stripe Connect agreement located here: <https://stripe.com/connect-account/legal>; provided, that by creating an account on the Platform, you hereby expressly authorize Swapstack to integrate Stripe Connect for purposes of facilitating the transactions set forth herein.  In support thereof, you further authorize Stripe to send any and all notices and forms, including without limitation, tax invoices, to Swapstack with respect to any payment amounts that are withheld upon transfer for purposes making applicable tax withholdings.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that Swapstack receives such forms or notices from Stripe, Swapstack shall promptly make all such documentation available to you on your account.    

   *Payments - Generally*

   You hereby agree that all payments shall be paid and accepted only through a payment mechanism provided or approved by Swapstack (an “**Approved Payment Mechanism**”), which terms are set forth below unless separately agreed to by Swapstack.

   *Self Service Payments*

   Upon connecting with an Advertiser and agreeing to engage in an advertising campaign, Writer shall be responsible for invoicing the Advertiser by clicking “Submit Invoice” on the Platform.  Upon clicking such option, Writer will be prompted to complete the “Advertising Fee” field, and Swapstack will automatically populate fields displaying the “Swapstack Platform Fee” and “Payment Processing Fee,” which shall in each case be determined in the sole discretion of Swapstack and the applicable payment processing vendor.  After completing the fields and clicking “Submit,” Writer’s invoice will automatically be submitted to the Advertiser for payment.  When the Advertiser pays Writer’s invoice submitted for payment on the Platform, its funds are submitted and paid through Stripe and remitted as follows: Stripe will (1) retain its “Payment Processing Fee,” (2) pay to Swapstack the “Swapstack Platform Fee” from the remaining balance, and (3) after first deducting and paying amounts for the Payment Processing Fee and Swapstack Platform Fee, remit and pay to Writer the remaining balance, which amount shall constitute the entirety of the Advertising Fee due and payable to Writer hereunder and shall be final and binding in all respects.  

   *Managed Campaign Payments* 

   Upon engaging in a Managed Campaign, Swapstack will submit to each applicable Advertiser an invoice manually computed to reflect aggregate payment terms related to the particular campaign requested thereby.  Upon receipt of such invoice, the Advertiser shall remit payment to Swapstack for further processing, which amount is paid to Swapstack via Stripe and is reduced by an amount equal to the applicable Payment Processing Fee.  Writer shall submit an invoice to Swapstack using the same mechanics set forth above in the Self Service Payments description, which amounts Swapstack shall pay to Writer after giving effect to reductions to cover the Payment Processing Fee and the Swapstack Platform Fee retained by Swapstack; provided, that the remaining balance shall constitute the entirety of the Managed Campaign Advertising Fee due and payable to any applicable Writers participating in such campaign and shall be final and binding in all respects.

   *Plug & Play Payments*

   Upon engaging in a Plug & Play affiliate program, Writer agrees to pre-approved newsletter advertising deals in which an Advertiser has agreed to pay to Writer a certain cash payment per qualifying event (defined as a customer conversion or click, in each case depending on the advertised Plug & Play deal).  Once per month, the applicable Advertiser will (1) complete a Plug & Play report summarizing newsletter conversion information, which Swapstack then uses to calculate fees due to Writer and (2) pay to any such Writer amounts due based on the total number of conversions or clicks across all newsletter multiplied by the agreed-up per-conversion/click amount, in each case as may be applicable. The Advertiser is responsible for paying the amounts set forth in the invoice to Swapstack, which keeps its Swapstack Platform Fee of 25% or such other amount reasonably determined by Swapstack in its sole discretion, and remits the balance to Writer via transfer on Stripe from Swapstack’s Stripe Account to Writer’s Stripe Account.  Such transfers shall not be subject to any Payment Processing Fee, unless otherwise determined by Stripe in its sole and reasonable discretion.    

   *Other*

   All fees shall be determined in respect of each particular campaign and shall not be changed, modified or amended without the express written consent of Swapstack.  If User becomes responsible under this Agreement to make any payments and fails to pay such amounts when due, User shall be responsible to Swapstack for all amounts due, plus any applicable processing fees, charges or penalties, collection costs (including but not limited to attorneys’ fees), and interest on the unpaid amount at the lesser of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or the maximum allowed by law. 

   Notwithstanding the foregoing, Swapstack shall in no event be responsible for (1) recovering or making any unpaid payments due to any party hereunder, or (2) making any payments under any campaign or functionality offered on its Platform to any User that has violated the terms of this Agreement or the Terms of Service or if otherwise contrary to, or in violation of, applicable law.  The User hereby agrees and acknowledges that to the extent applicable, Swapstack shall only transfer amounts to the applicable User hereunder if, as and when paid by the applicable Advertiser and/or Stripe in accordance with the terms of the particular campaign.  
3. **User Obligations and Agreements**

   Writer agrees that when Writer registers newsletters or other media on the Platform, and an Advertiser has accepted Writer’s offer to permit the Advertiser to advertise on Writer’s media, Writer agrees, acknowledges and understands that Writer shall be legally obligated to Swapstack and such Advertiser having agreed to advertise on Writer’s newsletter or other media using any of the foregoing Swapstack offerings to: (1) complete all project and campaign assignments using Writer’s best efforts consistent with Writer’s past practices; (2) accurately report and keep current all advertising data metrics for all newsletters and/or other media in which an Advertiser has agreed to advertise via the Swapstack Platform; (3) periodically update and report delivery results to any Advertiser that has engaged Writer on the Platform, including, without limitation, information related to number of recipients, open rate, list growth, forward rate, delivery rate, clickthrough rate and other related information reasonably requested by the Advertiser. 

   Advertiser agrees to make payments using the Approved Payment Mechanisms, using the Swapstack “Checkout” page or as otherwise provided via Swapstack invoice, as applicable.  With respect to the Plug & Play Campaign, Advertisers shall be required to report results to Writers no less frequently than on a monthly basis and will be terminated and removed from the Platform upon failure to so report within 21 days following the end of the previous month.  All such results shall be reported manually or using such other functionalities as may be provided by Swapstack.  Advertiser covenants and agrees to use customary and industry-accepted norms when calculating and generating such monthly reports and further covenants, represents and warrants that all reports shall be complete and accurate in all respects.  To the extent Writer disputes the Advertiser’s report or any findings or results set forth therein, Writer shall notify Advertiser of any such dispute or discrepancy and such parties shall use good faith efforts to resolve such issues.
4. **Communications with Users; No Disintermediation**

   All written communications between User and other Users must be conducted through the Platform or communication devices designated by Swapstack in writing. All such communications may not contain any requests to circumvent the Platform or the communication devices designated by Swapstack in writing.  All payments shall be made using the Approved Payment Mechanisms set forth above.

   During the term of this Agreement and for a period of ten (10) years after its expiration or termination (the “**Exclusivity Period**”), User shall (i) purchase all services relating to, or in any way connected with, any campaign or related matchmaking advertising service in accordance with the terms of this Agreement between any Advertisers and Writers on the Platform and (ii) not directly or indirectly solicit, contact or engage any Advertiser or Writer, as applicable, for purposes of performing services similar to those provided hereunder.  Any action during the Exclusivity Period by User that encourages, facilitates or solicits complete or partial payment outside of this Agreement or otherwise solicits for service engagement or any other similar business relationship with a User for services similar to those provided hereunder shall constitute a material violation of this Agreement (a “**Disintermediation Violation**”).  The User hereby agrees to pay to Swapstack liquidated damages for any Disintermediation Violation, in an amount equal to 10% of all fees paid by Advertiser in connection therewith.  The parties hereto further acknowledge that (a) the amount of loss or damages likely to be incurred by Swapstack for any Disintermediation Violation by User is impossible or difficult to precisely estimate, (b) the amounts specified herein bear a reasonable proportion and are not plainly or grossly disproportionate to the probable loss likely to be incurred by Swapstack, and (c) the parties are sophisticated business parties and have been represented by sophisticated legal and financial counsel and negotiated this Agreement at arm's length.  Liquidated damages shall be paid by User within ten (10) business days of User’s breach of this Section of the Agreement.   
5. **Release**

   User agrees that by entering into this Agreement, User, for User and User’s predecessors, successors, and assigns (together, the “**User Releasors**”), releases and forever discharges Swapstack and its predecessors, successors, assigns, agents, officers, directors, employees, subsidiaries, parents, affiliates, attorneys, contractors, and suppliers (together, the “**Swapstack Releasees**”) from and against all actions, causes of action, claims, suits, debts, damages, judgments, liabilities, rights, contracts, obligations, and demands, whether now known or unknown, liquidated or unliquidated, that any of the User Releasors has, may have, has asserted, or could have asserted, of any nature and relating to any subject, excluding the right of User to enforce this Agreement according to its terms.
