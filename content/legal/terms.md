**18. Copyright Policy.**

1. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the "DMCA") provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that materials posted on the Services infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send Swapstack a "Notification of Claimed Infringement" requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked. The notice must include the following information: 

   1. A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the works that have been allegedly infringed;



   2. Identification of the copyrighted work alleged to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the Services are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works);



   3. Identification of the specific material alleged to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow Swapstack to locate the material on the Services;



   4. Your name, address, telephone number, and email address (if available);



   5. A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and



   6. A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
2. If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send Swapstack a counter-notice.
3. Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see http://www.loc.gov/copyright/ for details. If you believe your copyrighted content has been displayed inappropriately on the Services, please contact us as noted below. Consult your legal advisor and see 17 U.S.C. 512 before filing a notice or counter-notice as there are penalties for false claims under the DMCA 

**19. Dispute Resolution.**



1. The TOS and the relationship between you and Swapstack will be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to its conflict of law provisions. You and Swapstack agree to submit to the personal, exclusive and binding arbitration of any disputes relating to your use of the Services under the rules of the American Arbitration Association. Any such arbitration, to the extent necessary, shall be conducted in Washington, D.C. You covenant not to sue Swapstack in any other forum.

The failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any time thereafter, nor will a waiver of any breach or default of the TOS or any provision of the TOS constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use of section headers in the TOS is for convenience only and will not have any impact on the interpretation of particular provisions. In the event that any part of the TOS is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part shall be given effect to the greatest extent possible and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect. You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and Swapstack as a result of the TOS or use of the Services.
