In contrast to the classified ads, which appear at the bottom of our newsletters and are distinct from the main body, a bespoke post is essentially the main bulk of the newsletter and serves as much more of a personal endorsement from us, directly associating your brand with ours. We’ll mention your brand and include a link of your choice as the post’s sponsor and inspiration.

**2. Weekly classified slot ($$$ Flat Rate. Sign-up for Swapstack to unlock the price.):**

A one-off, 200-character classified ad out in my popular weekly newsletter
