A collection of our favourite links, from insightful deep dives to whatever made us laugh on the internet today—just try not to click on one. Our signature playful tone sparks curiosity in our readers, so it's an ideal, cost-effective way for brands to engage with our audience by linking out to an e-commerce store, social channel or brand landing page.
  * **Staff Pick:** Our signature word-of-mouth shopping recommendations spotlight tried-and-tested (and obsessed-over) products that the Girlboss team stands behind. We unearth the coolest, most innovative and aesthetically pleasing finds across the skincare, beauty, fashion and lifestyle categories to inspire our readers to buy better. An ideal place to highlight a hero product, provide a discount code and tap into a word-of-mouth format that feels organic.
