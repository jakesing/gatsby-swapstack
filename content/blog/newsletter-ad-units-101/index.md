# The Basics

There are three basic types of ad units:

* Classified or Sponsored BY
* Shout outs
* Takeover or Deep Dive

## Classified or Sponsored by

Typically the shortest type of ad-unit, used to quickly call out a brand, partner or other story. Click Through Rates (CTRs) on these are typically low as well.

**Word count: ~**50 words or fewer

**Call to action:** Single link

**Images:** No image or logo (if less words).

## Shout Out

A shout-out is the most common type of ad, and can drive huge value if written in your words, and positioned high in your newsletter.

**Word count:** ~150-250

**Call to action:** Single or multiple links or buttons

**Images:** Single image or logo

## Shout Out

A deep dive can be hugely valuable to the brand in question, and if the brand is well aligned to your content & readership, your readers might love it. Typically a deep-dive is the center of a given newsletter.

**Word count:** ~500-1500

**Call to action:** Many links or buttons

**Images:** Multiple images
