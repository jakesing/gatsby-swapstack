## **What's happening in November?**

![welcome to No Fee November](https://github.com/jakesing/gatsby-swapstack/blob/main/src/pages/blog/article_images/nfn2.png?raw=true "welcome to No Fee November")

It's November, and you know what that means! Tons of mustaches, Black Friday & Holiday campaigns, fall weather (for those on the US-East Coast) and....***no fees for brands on Swapstack*.**

Typically, we charge a 10% platform fee to brands using the Swapstack platform and keep the platform 100% free to our creators. For the month of November, ***we are waiving the 10% platform fee for every brand!***

## **It's a celebration!**

It's been just about a year since our own newsletters (The Flywheel & The Premoney List) launched, and acted as the muse for what became Swapstack. 

Plus, we've had some [big news lately](https://theflywheel.substack.com/p/swapstack), and we want to celebrate with our users.

## **Why No-Fee November?**

**Our goals are to enable every creator to monetize their work and to provide brands access to a powerful growth channel that they can use to grow their businesses.** 

We believe whole-heartedly that creator marketing is one of the most powerful growth channels a brand can utilize, and we want to put our money where our mouth is!

Whether your brand is just starting to test newsletters as a channel, or has already seen value in newsletter marketing, we are here to support your efforts and want to make it as easy as possible to explore newsletter advertising as a channel! 

What's easier than free? Have a big product launch or sale going on for holiday season? Try out a newsletter ad through Swapstack!

*Note: In addition to the platform fee, we also add a 3% payment processing fee to every invoice. We use Stripe for payment processing, and this covers their fees. No Fee November only applies to the 10% platform fee, not the 3% Stripe fee, which will continue to appear on all invoices.*
