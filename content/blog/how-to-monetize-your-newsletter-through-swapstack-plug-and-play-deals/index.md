## What are Swapstack Plug and Play deals?

‚Äú*Never send a newsletter issue without a sponsor.‚Äù* That‚Äôs the motto behind Swapstack‚Äôs Plug and Play feature.

At Swapstack, our mission is to enable more people like you to monetize your work efficiently and effectively.

Plug and Play deals are our in-house affiliate deals that are pre-approved by Brands for Swapstack writers. Feature a Plug & Play sponsor on your newsletter, and get paid for any conversions you drive them.

If you‚Äôre a newsletter writer, you can run these ads *anytime* you'd like, meaning you never have to send a newsletter issue without a sponsor.

### A few benefits of running Plug and Play deals:

1. **Set up in seconds:** These are pre-approved by brands so you don‚Äôt have to do any outreach to run a sponsorship.
2. **Always have a sponsor:** These deals are especially useful when you‚Äôre just starting out and want to understand your audience's interests. Whether you have 100 subscribers or 100k subscribers, you don‚Äôt have to worry about not having a sponsor when you‚Äôre ready to monetize your newsletter.
3. **Fill your ad inventory:** Fill up your ad inventory and never send a newsletter issue without a sponsor. We‚Äôve seen writers running these deals as their main sponsor and also filling up the ‚ÄòClassified‚Äô section of their newsletter.

## How much one can potentially earn running these deals:

Let‚Äôs say you have a newsletter of 5,000 subscribers and you want to run one Plug and Play deal that rewards you $5 per conversion.

Assuming at least 1% of your list converts (i.e, 50 subscribers), then you‚Äôd potentially earn $250 (50 x $5) any time you run the deal in your newsletter.

## How to successfully run a Plug and Play deal:

Few tips to run a successful campaign with a Plug and Play deal:

1. Most advertisers encourage writers to personalize the Ad copy and creatives they provide to increase conversions. Make sure to utilize this freedom and structure your copy using your own voice.
2. If you‚Äôre running deals that are most aligned with your audience, try and include it as native content rather than sponsored. This will drive more conversions and will look like you‚Äôre not ‚Äúselling‚Äù something but, in fact, providing ‚Äúvalue‚Äù to your readers.
3. If your ‚ÄúClassifieds‚Äù section of the newsletter is not filled, Plug and Play deals would be perfect to fill your ad inventory. Make sure to craft the copy in a way that‚Äôs conversion oriented.

### A Few examples of how a Plug and Play deal actually looks like in the real world:

1. A Plug and Play deal of Swapstack by Swapstack on [The Premoney List](https://premoney.substack.com/) (our co-founder‚Äôs newsletter). So meta!

## How and when will I get paid for running a Plug and Play deal?

Getting paid for a Plug and Play deal is pretty straightforward:

* For every **conversion** you bring for a brand or a publisher‚Äôs deal, you‚Äôll get paid.
* At the beginning of every month, advertisers report the results from the previous month. We'll notify you by email when this happens, and you can always see the latest information in your Swapstack dashboard.
* We'll transfer the funds directly to your Stripe account as soon as the advertiser's payment is received.

## Tips and Takeaways:

* Plug and Play deals allow you to monetize your newsletter in more than one way. They‚Äôre pre-approved so you don‚Äôt have to ‚Äúpitch‚Äù any advertiser. You can run them anytime on your newsletter.
* Running the deals more than once is highly recommended as it increases the number of conversions you bring for the brands.
* Advertisers encourage writers to modify the provided creative copy. Utilize the freedom and structure your copy using your own voice.
* Fill your ad inventory by running Plug and Play deals and never send a newsletter issue without a sponsor.
