## Meet Noor Gupta, creator of ‘Touristy’- a Business newsletter for millennials

Noor was born and raised in New Delhi, India. She attended NYU for undergrad where she majored in Economics with a minor in Digital Media & Communication. During her final year at NYU, she started a travel blog. She was fortunate enough to travel a fair bit, so she started to pen down her travel experiences, whether it be hotel reviews or fine dining. That’s when she first got into writing.

Despite her love for travel, her blog didn’t get any traction. Noor attributes this to her content not being good enough to attract a consistent following in the travel space.

Noor had the writing-bug, and the lack of a following on her first venture didn’t dismay her from trying again. The concept of a media brand was extremely appealing to her, and she kept searching for a content genre that she could add value to.

During the Covid lockdown in 2020, she kicked off a new project, Touristy. She turned her knowledge and passion for business into an email newsletter specifically geared towards Millennials. 

## Touristy: Education Via Entertainment

[Touristy](https://touristy.substack.com/) is a newsletter that covers the latest stories in business, tech, and consumer trends with a witty spin. Noor strives to write in a sarcastic and fun way about topics that can often be dry and boring. Touristy achieves the perfect balance of educational yet entertaining content. She asks rhetorically, “why not deliver news in a format and tone that actually makes today’s generation want to read?”

Noor provides a weekly round up of cultural events, opinion pieces, emerging startups and other happenings shaping consumer culture. All this is done in a concise, digestible manner. Touristy puts the “brief” in “briefing”.

In contrast to her travel blog, Touristy has seen consistent growth and has crossed 60,000 subscribers organically, with a 50%+ open rate weekly.

## Advice to fellow newsletter authors

> "My biggest advice would be to be consistent. Trust is a function of being consistent and predictable over a long period of time. I haven’t missed a single week since April 2020 and to date, make sure I nurture every user as user 0.
>
> In fact, the one time my newsletter was a few hours late, I had emails from users asking if they were still on the email list or if something had gone wrong!
>
> In short, I have built credibility within my community via consistency." — Noor Gupta, Founder of Touristy
