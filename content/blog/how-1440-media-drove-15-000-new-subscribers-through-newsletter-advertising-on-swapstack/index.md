## Key Takeaways For Brands

So, what makes newsletter advertising so effective?

A creator builds their newsletter audience over time — developing their niche, finding their audience, and constantly providing value so they can maintain an engaged community of loyal readers. When a brand’s target audience matches with the niche of the newsletter, they are effectively leveraging the power of a community that was built over time and with consistent effort. This makes it much more targeted than an ad on social media. Platform algorithm and AI can rarely match the effectiveness a highly targeted newsletter audience promises.

Most people just *scroll* through social media, whereas they *read* newsletters. This means the audience is dedicated to reading the newsletter, and there are higher chances of the shout-out being noticed by the target audience.

A newsletter lands straight in the inboxes of the readers. Most people check their email in the morning as it takes the least effort compared to other social media channels. A well-placed ad can actually prompt a customer to make their first purchasing decision of the day even before they have their morning cup of coffee!

All in all, newsletter advertising is an incredibly powerful way for brands to reach a super targeted, niche audience. Swapstack is making this accessible, with hundreds of creators forming relationships with brands each day.
