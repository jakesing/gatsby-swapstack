> Instead of a constant back and forth between you and an advertiser, it lets you run advertisements that you're pre-approved for, and get paid based on how your ad performs. Perfectly aligned incentives, minimum work.\

Plug and Play deals are our in-house affiliate deals that are pre-approved by Brands for Swapstack writers. Feature a Plug & Play sponsor on your newsletter, and get paid for any conversions you drive.

If you’re a newsletter writer, you can run these ads *anytime* you’d like, meaning you never have to send a newsletter issue without a sponsor.

## 2. One Good Thing earned over $1,400

[One Good Thing by Jillee](https://www.onegoodthingbyjillee.com/newsletter/) shares brilliant tips for getting more done around the house with less time, effort and cost.

One of the reasons why Plug and Play deals are popular among our users is that they can easily fill up their ad inventory if they didn’t have a sponsor for their next issue.

The motto behind Plug and Play deals is that you *never* send a newsletter without a sponsor.

One Good Thing is one of them and so far they earned over $1,400 by running these affiliate deals on their newsletter.

## 2. Louis Pereira from Complexity Condensed and Read Something Great earned over $500

Louis is the founder behind Complexity Condensed and Read Something Great.

He explains complicated stuff explained in 500 simple words for curious people who are in a hurry through [Complexity Condensed](https://www.complexitycondensed.com/) newsletter.

He also built [Read Something Great](https://www.readsomethinggreat.com/), using a no-code tool called Bubble, to help people discover timeless articles. He shares one of these timeless articles once every week through his newsletter.

Out of the 20+ Plug and Play deals we have on the Swapstack platform, he thoughtfully chooses those deals that would suit his audience. So far, he ran several campaigns for Alts, The Daily Upside, and Morning Brew.

Through his 2 newsletters, he earned over $500 running these deals.

In his own words:

> As a newsletter writer, you want to be focused on writing, editing, and hitting publish, not on negotiating rates with advertisers.\
> \
> Swapstack's Plug & Play makes this easy.\
> \
> Instead of a constant back and forth between you and an advertiser, it lets you run advertisements that you're pre-approved for, and get paid based on how your ad performs. Perfectly aligned incentives, minimum work.\
> \
> I can't recommend it highly enough.

## **How much one can potentially earn running these deals:**

Let’s say you have a newsletter of 5,000 subscribers and you want to run one Plug and Play deal that rewards you $5 per conversion.

Assuming at least 1% of your list converts (i.e, 50 subscribers), then you’d potentially earn $250 (50 x $5) any time you run the deal in your newsletter.
